Special Substrings  Flag Question
You are given a string A. You have to find the product of the length of all special substrings of A.

A special substring is one that is also a prefix of given string A.



Input Format

Given only argument A of type String.
Output Format

Return an Integer X mod (1e9 + 7), i.e product of the length of all its special substrings.
Constraints

1 <= length(A) <= 1e5
string will have only lowercase letters.
For Example

Input:
    A = "ababa"

Output:
    720

Explanation:
    all special substrings of A are :
    1. a    [1 - 1]
    2. ab   [1 - 2]
    3. aba  [1 - 3]
    4. abab [1 - 4]
    5. ababa[1 - 5]
    6. a    [3 - 3]
    7. ab   [3 - 4]
    8. aba  [3 - 5]
    9. a    [5 - 5] 
    product there length mod (1e9 + 7) = (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 1 * 2 * 3 * 1) % (1e9 + 7) = 720
